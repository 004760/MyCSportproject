<h1>Luke's Vacations</h1>
<p>Here you will see a little about my most recent trip to Florida last Summer.</p>
 <h2>My Trip To Florida</h2>
 <p> Here is my trip to Florida described briefly: Me, my Dad and two sisters packed our bags and left for Florida last August. When we got their, we stayed at The Pink Shell Resort for about a week.
  For the first couple of days, we spent buying some more items for our hotel room such as food, sunscreen and whatnot. We did this at the evenings of these two days.
  For the earlier parts of the two days we swam in the Gulf of Mexico and the hotel pool. After the two days, we spent two days Pokemon hunting there, because at the time
  Pokemon GO was very popular at the time. We mainly shopped those two dyas and caught pokemon on the side. For the rest of thr week we went jet skiing on the Gulf Of
  Mexico and had a blast doing so. Overall we all loved the trip and would love to go back again. </p>
