<h1>Luke's Hobbies</h1>
<p>On this page you will see my top three hobbies.</p>
 <h2>Hobby #1, Baseball</h2>
 <p>I have played baseball since kindergarden. At first it was just another way to play with my friends, but then a grew a deeper, more serious love for the game. <br>
  it took a couple years to devolop this love, but it surely grew alot during those years. I still play baseball today, and don't plan on stopping to anytime soon.</p>
 <h2>Hobby #2, Gaming</h2>
 <p> I have been quite the gamer all the way since when I got my first Wii. I was definently young, (don't remember how young) and played mostly Mario related games such as Super Smash Bros and Mario Cart Wii. <br>
  However, as a got older I grew a love for first person shooter games. Sadly, most good first person shooters were on the Xbox 360. That's when I got my upgrade to a Xbox 360. I played mostly first and third person <br>
  shooters such as Call Of Duty, Black Ops 2, and other games similar too that. After several years with an Xbox 360, I got bumped up to an Xbox One. After about 2 years with the Xbox One, we have arrvied at the present.</p> 
 <h2>Hobby #3, Building</h2>
 <p> This hobby isn't quite as big as the first two, but it's still worth mentioning. I have a odd need to build crazy and awesome things. Whether it's a cool experiment that involves something blowing up or an a small wooden dune buggy,<br>
 I want to do it all. I haven't made too crazy of things, moslty becasue I only want to build in the summer, a time of year I am usally doing other events. but that doesn't stop my want to make things.</p>
