<h1>Luke's Portfolio Website</h1>
<p>(This website was created in February, 2017 for a Computer Science project.) Welcome to my website! This is a basic website that lets you get to know me a little. <br>
 You can learn about some of my hobbies, past projects and some vacations I have taken. Please feel free to look into any of these topics you are interested by using the navigation bar. However, I have attached three photos with descriptions telling you a little about me.\
 Also, all the pictures on my website is either taken by me or taken off of pixabay with no creative commons restrictions.</p>
 <img src="Space.jpg" alt="Outer Space" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
 <p> I used this picture because I love outer space.  I really started to find interest in space once we breifly went over it in science class in 6th grade.</p>
<img src="baseball-454559_1920.jpg" alt="Baseball" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
 <p>I used this image because of my long love for baseball. I have been plaing since kindergarden and plan on to keep going. Check out the "hobbies" tab to learn more! </p>
<img src="fsunset.jpg" alt="Sun" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
 <p> I used the image because I love to play and enjoy the Sun. During the day I play things such as baseball under the Sun, then like to look at the amazing, serene sunsets.</p>
