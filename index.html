<h1>Luke's Portfolio Website</h1>
<p>(This website was created in February, 2017 for a Computer Science project.) Welcome to my website! This is a basic website that lets you get to know me a little. <br>
 You can learn about some of my hobbies, past projects and some vacations I have taken. Please feel free to look into any of these topics you are interested by using the navigation bar. However, I have attached three photos with descriptions telling you a little about me.</p>
 <img src="Space.jpg" alt="Outer Space" style="width:350px;height:300px;">
 <p> I used this picture because I love outer space.  I really started to find interest in space once we breifly went over it in science class in 6th grade.</p>
